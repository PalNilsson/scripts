# scripts
A collection of useful scripts for ATLAS/PanDA work.

Archiving:
The archiving tool can be used to make self-extractable binaries from the source files located in the src directory.

Queuedata:
This script will download the queuedata for a given PanDA queue from the PanDA server.

Remote copy:
This is intended to be used on a Harvester node for transferring the grid proxy and queuedata to a remote shared file system (using gcloud command).
